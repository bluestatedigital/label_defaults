# Label Defaults
A Drupal 8 module to change the default label display
setting for newly-created fields from "Above" to 
whatever you want. You can still change the label display on
a field-by-field and display mode-by-display mode basis as you
could before.

## Installation
1. Download the module and add to your `modules/custom`
folder.
2. Enable the module.
3. Go to `/admin/structure/label_defaults` to configure the
default. (Out of the box, it will set "Hidden" as the default).
